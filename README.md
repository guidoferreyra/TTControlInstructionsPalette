# TTControlInstructionsPalette

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It adds a palette to the sidebar for writing [ttfAutohint control instructions](https://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/doc/ttfautohint.html#control-instructions).


### Installation

1. Open *Window > Plugin Manager.*
2. Click the Install button next to the *TT Control Instructions Palette* entry.
3. Restart Glyphs.

### Usage Instructions

coming soon

### Requirements

The plugin needs Glyphs 2.5 or higher. I assume it will not work in earlier versions.
